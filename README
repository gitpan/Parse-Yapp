IMPORTANT NOTES

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE.

Though it has been tested a lot, there are probably bugs in it ;-)

I need FEEDBACK for every problem or bug you could encounter so I can fix
them in the next release. Comments are welcome too.
But I also need FEEDBACK if you use it and have it work fine so I can step
to beta and production releases. Just drop me a mail.

The Parse::Yapp pod section is the main documentation and it assumes
you already have a good knowledge of yacc. If not, I suggest the GNU
Bison manual which is a very good tutorial to LALR parsing and yacc's
grammar syntax.

The documentation is only a draft and should be rewritten (I think).
Any help on this issue would be very welcome.

DESCRIPTION

This is the alpha release 0.14 of the Parse::Yapp parser generator.

It lets you create Perl OO fully reentrant LALR(1) parser
modules (see the Yapp.pm pod pages for more details) and has
been designed to be functionnaly as close as possible to yacc,
but using the full power of Perl and opened for enhancements.

REQUIREMENTS

Requires perl5.004 or better :)

It is written only in Perl, with standard distribution modules,
so you don't need any compiler nor special modules.

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

WARRANTY

This software comes with absolutly NO WARRANTY of any kind. 
I just hope it can be useful.
