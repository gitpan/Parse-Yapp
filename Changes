    - Error token '$error' becomes 'error' (like in yacc)
    - The '$end' token becomes ''
0.07  Never released
    - Default action become a separate entry in states hash
    - $COMPATIBLE value changed to 0.08
    - The grammar parser is now a Yapp parser module
    - Comments can be either Perl (#...\n) or C /* ... */ style
    - The parser accepts %type, %union and <type> constructs and
      almost ignore them, except checking consistency between token
      and non-terminal declarations (warnings)
    - The parser now has error recovery and consistent error line numbers
    - The parser now accepts "in rule" actions and generates pseudo
      empty rules to reduce, named @x-y, where x is a sequential
      number and y the 'dot position' in the rule for the driver
      to know how many parameters to pass to semantic action sub
    - Add "in rule" actions handling in Driver.pm
    - Empty rhs need not be the first one anymore
    - Warning if more than one empty rhs for a given lhs
0.08  Fri Jul 10 22:04:31 GMT 1998
    - Changed 'print STDERR' to 'warn' in parser.
    - Use of literal 'error' produces a warning and is treated as
      the error token
    - Add prefix 'YY' before each parser object methods to avoid
      clashes with user written methods
    - Renamed YYUserData to YYData (shorter and more consistent with
      other methods names)
    - Renamed YYLeftVal to YYSemval for same reasons
    - Modified Driver.pm so Semval(-n..n) reacts like $-n..$n in yacc
0.09  Never released
    - Changed test suite to 't/' style and add base tests for semantic
      actions/values and associativity tests
    - Check code to be (almost) Perl's -w compatible
    - Updates to pod section in Yapp.pm reflecting most of those changes
0.10  Mon Jul 13 20:53:40 GMT 1998
    - Cosmetic changes
0.11  Wed Jul 15 19:46:17 GMT 1998
    - Renamed Yapp::Parse parameters with a leading yy
    - Updated Yapp.pm pod section
0.12  Tue Jul 21 22:34:00 GMT 1998
0.13  Never released. (I'm not supersticious, but who knows...8-))
    - Renaming to Parse::Yapp for better CPAN entry...
0.14  Wed Jul 29 21:43:03 GMT 1998
    - Doc change: empty token is '', not undef (perl -w complains otherwise)
    - Bug in _ReduceGrammar: used $ruleno instead of $#{$grammar{RULES}}
      making no-terminal pointing to wrong rhs if useless rules.
